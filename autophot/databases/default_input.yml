  method: sp # str ---  Method for processing - serial [sp] or multi-processing [mp] (not working)

  ignore_no_telescop: False # bool ---  bool --- Ignore file if no telescope name given (given by TELESCOP header key). If False and an image is found without the TELESCOP header key, the use is asked for clarity.

  skip_file_check: False # bool --- set to True if you do not want Autophot to check though all fits files and ensure it has the correct information.

  cosmic_rays: # Commands for cosmic ray cleaning. Cosmic rays should be removed as they can lead to poor fitting when using PSF photometry and increased counts when using aperture. By default we use `Astroscrappy <https://github.com/astropy/astroscrappy>`_ for cosmic ray removal.

    remove_cmrays: True # bool --- If True, remove cosmic rays. This is left as a boolean option as some reduction pipelines may remove cosmic rays during their execution.

If this keyword is found, cosmic ray removal steps are ignored.

While masking out and possible sources, the average background value is determined using (sigma-clipped) statistics.
