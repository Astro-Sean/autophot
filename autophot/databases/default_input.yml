  fits_dir: null # str --- Directory where files are containing images with .fits .fts  or .fit extension.

  method: sp # str ---  Method for processing - serial [sp] or multi-processing [mp] (not working)

  ignore_no_telescop: False # bool ---  bool --- Ignore file if no telescope name given (given by TELESCOP header key)

  outdir_name: REDUCED # str ---  Extension of output directory. For example if parent directry (which is given in *fits_dir*) is SN1987A output directory will be SN1987A_REDUCED. The code will not overwrite an original data. Any image found in *fits_dir* is copied over to this new directory and we perform photometry on this new image.

  outcsv_name: REDUCED # str --- Output csv name containing all information from reduced files. During the photometric reduction of an individual image, a file containing information on the reduction and calibration named *out.csv* is created. During the automatic scripts, these *out.csv* are collected and concatenated into one file. This new file is named this variable.

  restart: False # bool ---This function allows the automated script to pick up where it left off, in the case where the script is ended prematurely on a dataset. i.e some images have been photometred and some have not. This will scan through output directory, see what has already been done and ignores it. This is heavily reliant on file paths and may not work if the output directory is modified by the user.

  cosmic_rays: # Commands for cosmic ray cleaning. Cosmic rays should be removed as they can lead to poor fitting when using PSF photometry and increased counts when using aperture. By default we use `Astroscrappy <https://github.com/astropy/astroscrappy>`_ for cosmic ray removal.

    remove_cmrays: True # bool --- If True, remove cosmic rays. This is left as a boolean option as some reduction pipelines may remove cosmic rays during their execution. If your data is already cleaned of cosmic rays. If an image has already be run through the automated script, the keyword *CRAY_RMD* is written to the file. If this keyword is found, cosmic ray removal steps are ignored.

This is the most robust method to background measurements, however it does take the longest computation time per fitting.

While masking out and possible sources, the average background value is determined using (sigma-clipped) statistics.
